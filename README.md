Displays song lyrics in-game.

> **Note**: Some songs loaded using [BeatSaver Downloader](https://github.com/andruzzzhka/BeatSaverDownloader) have invalid metadata, and thus won't be recognized.  
> If you want to use them anyway, you'll have to edit their metadata manually so that the song and artist names are valid.

## Installation
After installing any other mod for Beat Saber, drop [`BeatSinger.dll`](https://github.com/6A/BeatSinger/releases) into the `Beat Saber/Plugins` directory.

## Usage
- When lyrics for a song can be found, the message "lyrics found" will be shown at the beginning of the level song.
- Lyrics are automatically looked up using [musixmatch](https://www.musixmatch.com); you do not need to add them yourself.
- You can press the `S` key to toggle lyrics in-game.
